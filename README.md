## Objective
Develop a React application with user authentication functionality.

## Features

Implement user registration and login forms.
Use local storage or session storage to manage user sessions.
Display different content based on the user's authentication status (e.g., a login form vs. a welcome page).
Integrate with a backend authentication service or use a service like Firebase Authentication for user management.



## Technologies Used
React.js (with functional components)
React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
Firebase Authentication (for user management)
React Router (for navigation)
CSS (for styling the UI)

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

## Installation and Setup
 ## Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/user-auth-system.git
cd user-auth-system

## Install Dependencies:
npm install

## Set Up Firebase:
Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console.
Enable Authentication (Email/Password sign-in method).
Get the Firebase config and update firebase.js:

import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);

## Run the Application:
`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

## Usage
Register a new user using an email and password.
Login with registered credentials.
Logout to clear the session.
Session Management using Firebase Authentication and React state.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
